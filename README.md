# Worktree Manager

**Effortless git worktrees for parallel development**

A Claude Code plugin that creates and manages git worktrees with automatic environment setup. Built with a two-layer architecture: user-friendly plugin commands backed by a robust TypeScript MCP server.

## What This Does

Create isolated git worktrees for parallel feature development. Automatically detects project type and runs setup (npm install, swift build, etc.).

```bash
/worktree-manager:create bug-fix
# Creates ~/worktrees/bug-fix/ on branch feature/bug-fix with auto-setup
```

## Key Features

- **One command** creates worktree + new branch
- **Universal language support** - auto-detects 22+ ecosystems with smart package manager detection (Node.js with npm/yarn/pnpm/bun, Python with uv/Conda/Poetry/pipenv/pip, Swift, Deno, C++/CMake, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, Elixir, .NET, Scala, Flutter, Dart, iOS)
- **Auto-runs** setup commands for your project type
- **Auto-copies** environment files (.env, .vscode) to new worktrees
- **Advanced worktree operations** - move, lock, repair, and prune worktrees
- **Complete branch management** - rename and delete branches with safety checks
- **Create from existing branches** - checkout existing branches in new worktrees
- **99% test coverage** - reliable and well-tested (86 passing tests)
- **Parallel development** - work on multiple features simultaneously

## Architecture

This project consists of two layers:

### Why Two Layers?

- **Plugin layer**: User-friendly commands, integrates with Claude Code
- **MCP server layer**: Type-safe TypeScript with comprehensive tests
- **Separation of concerns**: UI in plugin, business logic in MCP server
- **Maintainability**: Update either layer independently

## Installation

### 1. Add the Marketplace

In Claude Code, run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add danielraffel/generous-corp-marketplace
```

### 2. Install the Plugin

```bash
/plugin install worktree-manager@generous-corp-marketplace
```

Or use the interactive installer:
1. Type `/plugin`
2. Navigate to "generous-corp-marketplace"
3. Select "worktree-manager"
4. Click "Install for you (user scope)"

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Quit and reopen Claude Code to load the plugin.

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
/plugin list
# Should show worktree-manager

/worktree-manager:list
# Should display your worktrees
```

## Usage

### Worktree Creation

```bash
# Create worktree with new branch
/worktree-manager:create my-feature

# Create worktree from existing branch
/worktree-manager:create my-feature --existing-branch=feature/existing

# Custom base branch
/worktree-manager:create hotfix --base-branch=develop

# Custom location
/worktree-manager:create experiment --worktree-path=/tmp/test
```

### What Happens

1. Creates worktree at `~/worktrees/my-feature/`
2. Creates branch `feature/my-feature`
3. Detects project type (web → npm, iOS → swift, etc.)
4. Runs setup commands automatically
5. Suggests next steps

### Auto-Detection & Setup

Automatically detects project type and runs appropriate setup commands:

| Ecosystem | Detection | Auto-Setup |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Node.js (web)** | `web/package.json` | `npm install` (or pnpm/yarn/bun based on lockfile) |
| **Node.js** | `package.json` (root) | `npm install` (or pnpm/yarn/bun based on lockfile) |
| **Python (uv)** | `uv.lock` | `uv sync` |
| **Python (Conda)** | `environment.yml` | `conda env create -f environment.yml` |
| **Python (Poetry)** | `pyproject.toml` + `poetry.lock` | `poetry install` |
| **Python (pipenv)** | `Pipfile` | `pipenv install` |
| **Python (pip)** | `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Python** | `setup.py` | `pip install -e .` |
| **Swift** | `Package.swift` | `swift package resolve` |
| **Deno** | `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc` | `deno cache --reload` |
| **C++ (CMake)** | `CMakeLists.txt` | `cmake -B build` |
| **Ruby** | `Gemfile` | `bundle install` |
| **Go** | `go.mod` | `go mod download` |
| **Rust** | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo fetch` |
| **Java (Maven)** | `pom.xml` | `mvn dependency:resolve` |
| **Java/Kotlin (Gradle)** | `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` | `gradle dependencies` |
| **PHP** | `composer.json` | `composer install` |
| **Elixir** | `mix.exs` | `mix deps.get` |
| **.NET** | `*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `*.vbproj` | `dotnet restore` |
| **Scala** | `build.sbt` | `sbt update` |
| **Flutter** | `pubspec.yaml` (with flutter) | `flutter pub get` |
| **Dart** | `pubspec.yaml` | `dart pub get` |
| **iOS** | `ios/` directory | Manual (Xcode) |
| **Full-stack** | Multiple ecosystems | Priority-based setup |

#### Automatic Environment Setup

**We detect your project type and ask you what to install—nothing runs without your permission.**

When you create a worktree:
1. We scan for all ecosystems (~100ms)
2. Show interactive menu with detected options
3. You select what to install (or skip all)
4. We run only your selections

**Multi-ecosystem example** (Node.js + Rust + Swift):
```
Which project types should I set up?
[x] Node.js (npm) - npm install
[ ] Rust - cargo fetch
[ ] Swift - swift package resolve
```
*Deselect all to skip setup entirely.*

**Control this behavior** via `auto_run_setup` config:
- `'prompt'` (default): Ask what to install - nothing runs without permission
- `'auto'`: Run first detected automatically - faster for single-language projects
- `false`: Skip all detection and setup

### List Worktrees

```bash
/worktree-manager:list
```

Shows all worktrees with:
- Path
- Branch name
- Commit SHA
- Uncommitted changes
- Untracked files

### Check Status

```bash
/worktree-manager:status
```

Shows git status for all worktrees.

### Cleanup

```bash
/worktree-manager:cleanup <path-or-branch>
```

Safely removes worktree after checking for uncommitted changes.

### Advanced Worktree Operations

**Move Worktree**
```bash
# Move worktree to new location
/worktree-manager:move ~/worktrees/old-feature ~/worktrees/new-location
```

Git automatically updates all internal references.

**Lock Worktree**
```bash
# Prevent accidental removal
/worktree-manager:lock ~/worktrees/important-feature

# With custom reason
/worktree-manager:lock ~/worktrees/important-feature --reason="In active development"
```

Use when you want to protect a worktree from being deleted.

**Unlock Worktree**
```bash
# Allow removal again
/worktree-manager:unlock ~/worktrees/important-feature
```

**Repair Worktree**
```bash
# Fix broken worktree references
/worktree-manager:repair ~/worktrees/my-feature
```

Use when worktree was manually moved or parent repository moved.

**Prune Orphaned Worktrees**
```bash
# Clean up references to deleted worktrees
/worktree-manager:prune
```

Removes administrative references to worktrees that were manually deleted.

### Branch Management

**Rename Branch**
```bash
# Rename branch in worktree
/worktree-manager:rename-branch ~/worktrees/feature old-name new-name
```

Updates all git references automatically.

**Delete Branch**
```bash
# Delete local branch
/worktree-manager:delete-branch feature/old-feature

# Delete with safety checks bypassed (unmerged branches)
/worktree-manager:delete-branch feature/experiment --force

# Delete local and remote
/worktree-manager:delete-branch feature/done --delete-remote

# Delete from specific remote
/worktree-manager:delete-branch feature/test --delete-remote --remote=upstream
```

Safety checks prevent deletion of unmerged branches unless `--force` is used.

## Parallel Development

Worktree Manager enables true parallel development. You can:

1. **Create multiple worktrees** for different features
2. **Open separate Claude Code sessions** in each worktree
3. **Work on multiple features simultaneously** without conflicts

```bash
# Terminal 1: Work on feature A
/worktree-manager:create feature-a
cd ~/worktrees/feature-a
claude

# Terminal 2: Work on feature B
/worktree-manager:create feature-b
cd ~/worktrees/feature-b
claude
```

### Pairs with Chainer

For automated workflows (planning + implementation), pair with [Chainer](https://www.generouscorp.com/Chainer):

```bash
# Create worktree
/worktree-manager:create payments

# Use Chainer for automated development
/chainer:run plan-and-implement \
  --cwd="~/worktrees/payments" \
  --prompt="Add Stripe integration"
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.claude/worktree-manager.local.md` (global) or `.claude/worktree-manager.local.md` (project-specific):

```yaml
---
# Where to create worktrees (default: ~/worktrees)
worktree_base_path: ~/worktrees

# Branch prefix (default: feature/)
branch_prefix: feature/

# Create LEARNINGS.md in worktree to capture insights
create_learnings_file: false

# Auto-initialize git submodules (default: true)
auto_init_submodules: true

# Setup behavior: 'auto' (run first detected), 'prompt' (ask which to run), false (skip)
# - 'prompt' (default): Interactive - asks which ecosystems to set up (recommended for multi-ecosystem repos)
# - 'auto': Legacy behavior - runs first detected ecosystem automatically
# - false: Skips all setup
auto_run_setup: prompt

# Auto-copy environment files to new worktrees (default: true)
copy_files_enabled: true

# Glob patterns for files to copy (default: ['.env', '.env.*', '.vscode/**', '*.local'])
copy_file_patterns: [".env", ".env.*", ".vscode/**", "*.local"]

# Glob patterns to exclude from copying (default: ['node_modules', 'dist', 'build', 'coverage', '.git'])
exclude_file_patterns: ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "coverage", ".git"]

# Auto-commit changes during AI agent execution
auto_commit: false

# Auto-push to remote after commits
auto_push: false

# Default workflow type (always 'simple' for worktree-only)
default_workflow: simple

# Directory for spec files (default: audit)
spec_directory: audit

# Max iterations for automated workflows (default: 50)
default_max_iterations: 50
---

# Project-Specific Notes
Add any project-specific context or conventions here.

## Design Philosophy

Worktree Manager follows a focused, single-responsibility approach:

- **Do one thing well**: Create and manage git worktrees with automatic setup
- **Two-layer architecture**: User-friendly plugin commands + robust TypeScript backend
- **99% test coverage**: Reliable, well-tested codebase
- **Composable**: Works standalone or pairs with other plugins (like Chainer) for workflows
- **Clean separation**: Worktree operations here, workflow orchestration elsewhere

## Related Projects

- **[Chainer](https://www.generouscorp.com/Chainer)** - Universal plugin orchestration for Claude Code (pairs well with Worktree Manager for automated workflows)

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please:

1. Run tests: `cd mcp-server && npm test`
2. Ensure coverage stays at 99%+
3. Update README if adding features
4. Follow existing code style

## Troubleshooting

### Worktree already exists

```
❌ Worktree already exists with uncommitted changes
```

**Fix**: Commit or stash changes, or use `/worktree-manager:cleanup` to remove it.

### Not in a git repository

```
❌ Current directory is not a git repository
```

**Fix**: Navigate to a git repository first.

### Setup failed

```
⚠️ Worktree created but setup incomplete
```

**Fix**: Run setup manually:
```bash
cd ~/worktrees/my-feature
npm install  # or appropriate setup command
```
